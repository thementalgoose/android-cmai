CyanogenMod App Installer is a solution for those who want the CyanogenMod apps on Stock Android or another ROM. It works by pulling the APK from the application, downloading it to your device and and installing it on to the system, with the option if you're running Android 4.4 or below to install it as a root user, pushing it directly to your /system/app folder and setting the appropriate permissions.

New features:
- Now all localised from Github
- Added some 6.0 apps 

Currently the application includes:
- Apollo
- Calculator
- CM File Manager
- Torch
- Messaging
- DSP Manager
- Voice+
- News and Weather Widget
- Trebuchet Launcher
- cLock Widget
- Movie Studio
- CM Wallpapers

Disclaimer: I do not take responsibility for any damage to your system that this does. Use at your own risk. The application if you are not rooted will only attempt to install apps that aren't malicious, so shouldn't cause any issues. Note if you use the root method you could irreversibly lose the application (even though a backup is made!)

Any issues you have regarding this, feel free to email me [here](mailto:thementalgoose@gmail.com?subject=CMAI)
